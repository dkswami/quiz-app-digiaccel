I've implemented the project using Node (NESTJS) as backend server and React(NextJS) as frontend server.
Admin credentials: admin@test.com and 12345678
Here are the deployment links:-
Backend:  https://api.dkswami.tech/api/v1
<br/>
Frontend: https://www.dkswami.tech/

This application includes authentication with JWT.

POSTMAN Api collection:-
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/252f0e099a571eb860ac?action=collection%2Fimport)

Note : The App may show server is down because it costs to run backend server on aws.
So, ask me to turn it on.
